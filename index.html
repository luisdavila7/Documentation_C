            <p> C is a general-purpose, procedural computer programming language supporting structured programming, lexical variable scope, and recursion, with a static type system. By design, C provides constructs that map efficiently to typical machine instructions. It has found lasting use in applications previously coded in assembly language. Such applications include operating systems and various application software for computer architectures that range from supercomputers to PLCs and embedded systems.</p>
      
            <p> A successor to the programming language B, C was originally developed at Bell Labs by Dennis Ritchie between 1972 and 1973 to construct utilities running on Unix. It was applied to re-implementing the kernel of the Unix operating system. During the 1980s, C gradually gained popularity. It has become one of the most widely used programming languages, with C compilers from various vendors available for the majority of existing computer architectures and operating systems. C has been standardized by ANSI since 1989 (ANSI C) and by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO).</p>

            <p>C is an imperative procedural language. It was designed to be compiled to provide low-level access to memory and language constructs that map efficiently to machine instructions, all with minimal runtime support. Despite its low-level capabilities, the language was designed to encourage cross-platform programming. A standards-compliant C program written with portability in mind can be compiled for a wide variety of computer platforms and operating systems with few changes to its source code. </p>
            
            <p>Since 2000, C has consistently ranked among the top two languages in the TIOBE index, a measure of the popularity of programming languages.</p>

            <p> The C language is a structured language, in the same sense that other languages are.
              programming languages such as Pascal, Ada or Modula-2, but It is not structured by blocks, that is, it is not possible to declare subroutines (small program chunks) within other subroutines, unlike other subroutines structured languages such as Pascal. Furthermore, the C language is not rigid in checking data types, allowing easy conversion between different data types and mapping between different data types.
            </p>
      
            <p>Every C program basically consists of a set of functions, and a function called main, which is the first one that is executed at the beginning of the program, calling from it to the rest of the functions that make up our program.

          <header>C and C++</header>
          <article>
            <p>C and C++ are two of the oldest surviving programming languages. The latter is directly derived from the former but flaunts more efficiency and productivity. Of course, both programming languages have their own advantages and drawbacks over one another.</p>
            
            <p>To provide you with an overview of C vs C++, C++ is an enhanced version of the C programming language with an additional feature of being object-oriented. C has been the motivation behind the birth of not only C++ but a multitude of presently popular high-level programming languages to the likes of Java, PHP, and Python.</p>

            <h2>Difference between C and C++</h2>
            
            <p>Before going in-depth into the difference between C and C++, let us first have a brief look at both the languages.</p>

            <h3>What is C?</h3>
      
            <p> Popularly known as the Father of Modern Programming, C made its first appearance in 1972 and was developed by Dennis Ritchie while working at Bells Labs. Though originally created for making utilities capable to run on the Unix platform, it is now one of the most widely used programming languages in the world. </p>
            <p> C is a procedural programming language that works on the lowest level of abstraction and hence is a systems programming language. It is compiled, lightweight, and offers manual memory management.</p>

            <p>The strength of C programming language lies in performance and has the ability to be used for coding for a wide variety of platforms. Hence, the programming language can be used for coding almost anything.</p>

            <p>Though nowadays we have specialized as well as a wide variety of programming languages to pick from, C was a great invention during its infancy and early years. Its level of versatility was unmatchable during its younger years.</p>

            <h3>What is C++?</h3>

            <p>Designed by Bjarne Stroustrup, C++ first made its appearance in 1985 and was considered as the best prodigy of C. Bjarne started working on the programming language while working at Bell Labs in 1979. He wanted to develop an extension to the C programming language that is both more efficient and flexible than the C.</p>

            <p>C++ provides support for object-oriented programming. It offers a low level of abstraction and requires manual memory management. The programming language is comparable to C, lightweight, and compiled. It is capable of developing apps for a diverse range of platforms.</p>
            
            <p>The C++ programming language has almost everything that C has to offer but in a better way. Like its original inspiration, the C programming language, C++ has and continues to, influence a range of high-level programming languages, such as C# and Java.</p>

            <h3>Comparison Between C vs C++</h3>

            <p>Application Development Area: C is a good option for embedded devices and system-level code. C++, on the contrary, is a top choice for developing gaming, networking, and server-side applications. It is also a great option for the development of device drivers.
              
            The authority of C++ lies in performance and speed. Though C also offers these both qualities, C++ takes it a step further.</p>

            <h3>C vs C++: When and Which to Pick?</h3>

            <h4>You need to pick C over C++ when:</h4>

            <li>Coding truly tiny systems (results in a little less overhead as compared to using C++)</li>
            <li>The application needs to be incredibly stable (Impermeable code and control results by removing the abstractions of C++)</li>
            <li>You don't have a C++ compiler on the platform of choice for application development</li>

            <h4>You need to choose C++ over C when:</h4>

            <li>Developing an application that works directly with the computer hardware</li>
            <li>Developing an application that deals with application development</li>
            <li>The project aims for extremely low-level processing</li>

        <section class="main-section" id="Hello_world">
          <header>Hello world</header>
          <article>
            <p>To create a simple C program which prints "Hello, World" on the screen, use a text editor to create a new file (e.g. hello.c â€” the file extension must be .c) containing the following source code:</p>
            <code>
              /* my first program in C */

              #include &#60stdio.h&#62
                int main(void) {
                
                prinft("Hello, World");

                return 0;
              }        
            </code>
            <p>In a C program, the semicolon is a statement terminator. That is, each individual statement must be ended with a semicolon. It indicates the end of one logical entity</p>

            <p>Comments are like helping text in your C program and they are ignored by the compiler. They start with /* and terminate with the characters */ </p>

            <p>A line containing only whitespace, possibly with a comment, is known as a blank line, and a C compiler totally ignores it. Whitespace is the term used in C to describe blanks, tabs, newline characters and comments. Whitespace separates one part of a statement from another and enables the compiler to identify where one element in a statement, such as int, ends and the next element begins.</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="Line_by_line">
          <header>Line by line</header>
          <article>
            <p>Let's look at this simple program line by line

              <code> #include &#60stdio.h&#62 </code>
             
              This line tells the compiler to include the contents of the standard library header file stdio.h in the program. Headers are usually files containing function declarations, macros and data types, and you must include the header file before you use them. This line includes stdio.h so it can call the function puts().</p>
      
              <code> int main(void) </code>

            <p>This line starts the definition of a function. It states the name of the function (main), the type and number of arguments it expects (void, meaning none), and the type of value that this function returns (int). Program execution starts in the main() function.</p>

            <code> {
              (statements)
              }
            </code>

            <p>The curly braces are used in pairs to indicate where a block of code begins and ends. They can be used in a lot of ways, but in this case they indicate where the function begins and ends.</p>

            <code> printf("Hello, World"); </code>


            <p>This line calls the printf(), this is a function to output text to standard output (the screen, by default), followed by a newline. The string to be output is included within the parentheses.</p>

            <p><b style="color:red;"> "Hello, World" </b> is the string that will be written to the screen. In C, every string literal value must be inside the
            double quotes "â€¦".</p>

            <p>In C programs, every statement needs to be terminated by a semi-colon (i.e. ;).</p>

            <code> return 0; </code>

            <p>When we defined main(), we declared it as a function returning an int, meaning it needs to return an integer. In this example, we are returning the integer value 0, which is used to indicate that the program exited successfully. After the return 0; statement, the execution process will terminate.</p>

            <h4>Editing the program</h4>

            <p>Simple text editors include vim or gedit on Linux, or Notepad on Windows. Cross-platform editors also include Visual Studio Code or Sublime Text.</p>
            
            <p>The editor must create plain text files, not RTF or other any other format.</p>

            <h4> Compiling and running the program </h4>
            
            <p>To run the program, this source file (hello.c) first needs to be compiled into an executable file (e.g. hello on Unix/Linux system or hello.exe on Windows). This is done using a compiler for the C language.</p>

            <h4>Compiling and running the program</h4>
            
            <p>To run the program, this source file (hello.c) first needs to be compiled into an executable file (e.g. hello on Unix/Linux system or hello.exe on Windows). This is done using a compiler for the C language.</p>

            <h4>Executing the program</h4>

            <p>Once compiled, the binary file may then be executed by typing ./hello in the terminal. Upon execution, the compiled program will print Hello, World, followed by a newline, to the command prompt.</p>

          <header>Data types</header>
          <article>
            <p>Data types in c refer to an extensive system used for declaring variables or functions of different types. The type of a variable determines how much space it occupies in storage and how the bit pattern stored is interpreted.</p>

            <p><b>Types & Description</b></p>

            <ul>
                  <li>Basic Types: They are arithmetic types and are further classified into: (a) integer types and (b) floating-point types.</li>
                  <li>Enumerated types: They are again arithmetic types and they are used to define variables that can only assign certain discrete integer values throughout the program.</li>
                  <li>The type void: The type specifier void indicates that no value is available.</li>
                  <li>Derived types: They include (a) Pointer types, (b) Array types, (c) Structure types, (d) Union types and (e) Function types.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The array types and structure types are referred collectively as the aggregate types. The type of a function specifies the type of the function's return value. We will see the basic types in the following section, where as other types will be covered in the upcoming chapters.</p>
            
            <p><b>Integer Types</b></p>
            <p>The following table provides the details of standard integer types with their storage sizes and value ranges</p>

            <p>I'll present this by type, storage size, and value range.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>char, 1 byte, -128 to 127 or 0 to 255</li>
                <li>unsigned char, 1 byte,	0 to 255</li>
                <li>signed char, 1 byte,	-128 to 127</li>
                <li>int, 2 or 4 bytes, -32,768 to 32,767 or -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647</li>
                <li>unsigned int, 2 or 4 bytes, 0 to 65,535 or 0 to 4,294,967,295</li>
                <li>short, 2 bytes, -32,768 to 32,767</li>
                <li>unsigned short, 2 bytes, 0 to 65,535</li>
                <li>long, 8 bytes or (4bytes for 32 bit OS), -9223372036854775808 to 9223372036854775807</li>
                <li>unsigned long, 8 bytes, 0 to 18446744073709551615</li>
            </ul>

            <p>To get the exact size of a type or a variable on a particular platform, you can use the sizeof operator. The expressions sizeof(type) yields the storage size of the object or type in bytes. Given below is an example to get the size of various type on a machine using different constant defined in limits.h header file</p>

          <header>Variables</header>
          <p> A variable is nothing but a name given to a storage area that our programs can manipulate. Each variable in C has a specific type, which determines the size and layout of the variable's memory; the range of values that can be stored within that memory; and the set of operations that can be applied to the variable.</p>
          <p>The name of a variable can be composed of letters, digits, and the underscore character. It must begin with either a letter or an underscore. Upper and lowercase letters are distinct because C is case-sensitive. Based on the basic types explained in the previous chapter, there will be the following basic variable types</p>

          <p><b>Type & Description</b></p>
          <ul>
              <li>char: Typically a single octet(one byte). It is an integer type.</li>
              <li>int: The most natural size of integer for the machine.</li>
              <li>float: A single-precision floating point value.</li>
              <li>double: A double-precision floating point value.</li>
              <li>void: Represents the absence of type.</li>
          </ul>

            <p>C programming language also allows to define various other types of variables, which we will cover in subsequent chapters like Enumeration, Pointer, Array, Structure, Union, etc. For this chapter, let us study only basic variable types.</p>

            <h3>Variable Definition in C</h3>

            <p>A variable definition tells the compiler where and how much storage to create for the variable. A variable definition specifies a data type and contains a list of one or more variables of that type as follows</p>

            <code> type variable_list;
            </code>

            <p>Here, type must be a valid C data type including char, w_char, int, float, double, bool, or any user-defined object; and variable_list may consist of one or more identifier names separated by commas. Some valid declarations are shown here</p>

            <code> int    i, j, k;
                  char   c, ch;
                  float  f, salary;
                  double d;
            </code>

            <p>The line int i, j, k; declares and defines the variables i, j, and k; which instruct the compiler to create variables named i, j and k of type int.</p>

            <p>Variables can be initialized (assigned an initial value) in their declaration. The initializer consists of an equal sign followed by a constant expression as follows</p>

            <code>
              type variable_name = value;
            </code>

            <p>Some examples are: </p>
            <code>extern int d = 3, f = 5;    // declaration of d and f. 
              int d = 3, f = 5;           // definition and initializing d and f. 
              byte z = 22;                // definition and initializes z. 
              char x = 'x';               // the variable x has the value 'x'.
            </code>

            <p>For definition without an initializer: variables with static storage duration are implicitly initialized with NULL (all bytes have the value 0); the initial value of all other variables are undefined.</p>

        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Variable_Declaration_in_C">
          <header>Variable Declaration in C</header>
          <article>

            <p>A variable declaration provides assurance to the compiler that there exists a variable with the given type and name so that the compiler can proceed for further compilation without requiring the complete detail about the variable. A variable definition has its meaning at the time of compilation only, the compiler needs actual variable definition at the time of linking the program.</p>

           <p>A variable declaration is useful when you are using multiple files and you define your variable in one of the files which will be available at the time of linking of the program. You will use the keyword extern to declare a variable at any place. Though you can declare a variable multiple times in your C program, it can be defined only once in a file, a function, or a block of code.</p>

            <p>Example: </p>
            <p>Try the following example, where variables have been declared at the top, but they have been defined and initialized inside the main function</p>

            <code> // Variable declaration:
              extern int a, b;
              extern int c;
              extern float f;
              
              int main () {
              
                 /* variable definition: */
                 int a, b;
                 int c;
                 float f;
               
                 /* actual initialization */
                 a = 10;
                 b = 20;
                
                 c = a + b;
                 printf("value of c : %d \n", c);
              
                 f = 70.0/3.0;
                 printf("value of f : %f \n", f);
               
                 return 0;
              }
            </code>

            <p>When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result</p>

            <code>value of c : 30
              value of f : 23.333334</code>

            <p>The same concept applies on function declaration where you provide a function name at the time of its declaration and its actual definition can be given anywhere else. For example</p>

            <code>// function declaration
              int func();
              
              int main() {
              
                 // function call
                 int i = func();
              }
              
              // function definition
              int func() {
                 return 0;
              }</code>

              <h4>Lvalues and Rvalues in C</h4>

              <p>There are two kinds of expressions in C</p>

              <ul>
                <li>lvalue: Expressions that refer to a memory location are called "lvalue" expressions. An lvalue may appear as either the left-hand or right-hand side of an assignment</li>
                <li>rvalue: The term rvalue refers to a data value that is stored at some address in memory. An rvalue is an expression that cannot have a value assigned to it which means an rvalue may appear on the right-hand side but not on the left-hand side of an assignment.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Variables are lvalues and so they may appear on the left-hand side of an assignment. Numeric literals are rvalues and so they may not be assigned and cannot appear on the left-hand side. Take a look at the following valid and invalid statements</p>

              <code>int g = 20; // valid statement

                10 = 20; // invalid statement; would generate compile-time error
              </code>

        <section class="main-section" id="Constants_and_Literals">
          <header>Constants and Literals</header>
          <article>
            <p>Constants refer to fixed values that the program may not alter during its execution. These fixed values are also called <b>literals.</b></p>
      
            <p>Constants can be of any of the basic data types like an integer constant, a floating constant, a character constant, or a string literal. There are enumeration constants as well.</p>
            <p> Constants are treated just like regular variables except that their values cannot be modified after their definition.</p>

            <h4>The #define Preprocessor</h4>
            <p>Given below is the form to use #define preprocessor to define a constant</p>

            <code>#define identifier value</code>

            <p>The following example explains it in detail</p>

            <code>#include &#60stdio.h&#62
              #define LENGTH 10   
              #define WIDTH  5
              #define NEWLINE '\n'
              
              int main() {
                 int area;  
                
                 area = LENGTH * WIDTH;
                 printf("value of area : %d", area);
                 printf("%c", NEWLINE);
              
                 return 0;
              }</code>

              <p>When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result</p>

              <code>value of area : 50</code>

              <h4>The const Keyword</h4>

              <p>You can use const prefix to declare constants with a specific type as follows</p>

              <code>const type variable = value;</code>

              <p>The following example explains it in detail</p>

              <code>#include &360stdio.h&#62

                int main() {
                   const int  LENGTH = 10;
                   const int  WIDTH = 5;
                   const char NEWLINE = '\n';
                   int area;  
                   
                   area = LENGTH * WIDTH;
                   printf("value of area : %d", area);
                   printf("%c", NEWLINE);
                
                   return 0;
                }</code>

                <p>When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result</p>

                <code>value of area : 50</code>

          <header>Decision Making</header>
          <article>
            <p>Decision making structures require that the programmer specifies one or more conditions to be evaluated or tested by the program, along with a statement or statements to be executed if the condition is determined to be true, and optionally, other statements to be executed if the condition is determined to be false. </p>

            <img class="img" src="media/decision_making.jpg">
      
            <p>Show below is the general form of a typical decision making structure found in most of the programming languages</p>
      
            <p>C programming language assumes any non-zero and non-null values as true, and if it is either zero or null, then it is assumed as false value.</p>
      
            <p>C programming language provides the following types of decision making statements.</p>
      
            <h4>Statement & Description</h4>

            <ul>
              <li>if statement: An if statement consists of a boolean expression followed by one or more statements.</li>
              <li>if...else statement: An if statement can be followed by an optional else statement, which executes when the Boolean expression is false.</li>
              <li>nested if statements: You can use one if or else if statement inside another if or else if statement(s).</li>
              <li>switch statement: A switch statement allows a variable to be tested for equality against a list of values.</li>
              <li>nested switch statements: You can use one switch statement inside another switch statement(s).</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>The ? : Operator</h4>

            <p>We have covered conditional operator ? : in the previous chapter which can be used to replace if...else statements. It has the following general form</p>

            <p>Where Exp1, Exp2, and Exp3 are expressions. Notice the use and placement of the colon.</p>
              
            <p>The value of a ? expression is determined like this</p>

            <ul>
              <li>Exp1 is evaluated. If it is true, then Exp2 is evaluated and becomes the value of the entire ? expression.</li>
              <li>If Exp1 is false, then Exp3 is evaluated and its value becomes the value of the expression.</li>
            </ul>

        <section class="main-section" id="Loops">
          <header>Loops</header>
          <article>

            <p>You may encounter situations, when a block of code needs to be executed several number of times. In general, statements are executed sequentially: The first statement in a function is executed first, followed by the second, and so on.</p>

            <p>Programming languages provide various control structures that allow for more complicated execution paths.</p>

            <p>A loop statement allows us to execute a statement or group of statements multiple times. Given below is the general form of a loop statement in most of the programming languages</p>

            <img class="img" src="media/loop_architecture.jpg">

            <p>C programming language provides the following types of loops to handle looping requirements.</p>

            <h4>Loop Type & Description</h4>

            <ul>
              <li>while loop: Repeats a statement or group of statements while a given condition is true. It tests the condition before executing the loop body.</li>

              <li>for loop: Executes a sequence of statements multiple times and abbreviates the code that manages the loop variable.</li>

              <li>do...while loop: It is more like a while statement, except that it tests the condition at the end of the loop body.</li>

              <li>nested loops: You can use one or more loops inside any other while, for, or do..while loop.</li>
            </ul>

           <h3>Loop Control Statements</h3>

           <p>Loop control statements change execution from its normal sequence. When execution leaves a scope, all automatic objects that were created in that scope are destroyed.</p>

           <p>C supports the following control statements.</p>

           <h4>Control Statement & Description</h4>

           <ul>
             <li>break statement: Terminates the loop or switch statement and transfers execution to the statement immediately following the loop or switch.</li>

             <li>continue statement: Causes the loop to skip the remainder of its body and immediately retest its condition prior to reiterating.</li>

             <li>goto statement: Transfers control to the labeled statement.</li>
           </ul>

           <h3>The Infinite Loop</h3>

           <p>A loop becomes an infinite loop if a condition never becomes false. The for loop is traditionally used for this purpose. Since none of the three expressions that form the 'for' loop are required, you can make an endless loop by leaving the conditional expression empty.</p>

           <code>#include &#60stdio.h&#62
 
            int main () {
            
               for( ; ; ) {
                  printf("This loop will run forever.\n");
               }
            
               return 0;
            }</code>

            <p>When the conditional expression is absent, it is assumed to be true. You may have an initialization and increment expression, but C programmers more commonly use the for(;;) construct to signify an infinite loop.</p>

            <p><b>NOTE: </b>You can terminate an infinite loop by pressing Ctrl + C keys.</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="Functions">
          <header>Functions</header>
          <article>
            
            
            <p>A function is a group of statements that together perform a task. Every C program has at least one function, which is main(), and all the most trivial programs can define additional functions.</p>
            <p>You can divide up your code into separate functions. How you divide up your code among different functions is up to you, but logically the division is such that each function performs a specific task.</p>
            <p>A function declaration tells the compiler about a function's name, return type, and parameters. A function definition provides the actual body of the function.</p>
            <p>The C standard library provides numerous built-in functions that your program can call. For example, strcat() to concatenate two strings, memcpy() to copy one memory location to another location, and many more functions.</p>
            <p>A function can also be referred as a method or a sub-routine or a procedure, etc.</p>

            <h4>Defining a Function</h4>

            <p>The general form of a function definition in C programming language is as follows</p>

            <code>return_type function_name( parameter list ) {
              body of the function
             }
            </code>

            <p>A function definition in C programming consists of a function header and a function body. Here are all the parts of a function:</p>
      
            <ul>
              <li>Return Type: A function may return a value. The return_type is the data type of the value the function returns. Some functions perform the desired operations without returning a value. In this case, the return_type is the keyword void.</li>
              <li>Function Name: This is the actual name of the function. The function name and the parameter list together constitute the function signature.</li>
              <li>Parameters: A parameter is like a placeholder. When a function is invoked, you pass a value to the parameter. This value is referred to as actual parameter or argument. The parameter list refers to the type, order, and number of the parameters of a function. Parameters are optional; that is, a function may contain no parameters.</li>
              <li>Function Body: The function body contains a collection of statements that define what the function does.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Example: </h4>

            <p>Given below is the source code for a function called max(). This function takes two parameters num1 and num2 and returns the maximum value between the two.</p>

            <code>/* function returning the max between two numbers */
              int max(int num1, int num2) {
              
                 /* local variable declaration */
                 int result;
               
                 if (num1 &#62 num2)
                    result = num1;
                 else
                    result = num2;
               
                 return result; 
              }</code>

              <h4>Function Declarations</h4>

              <p>A function declaration tells the compiler about a function name and how to call the function. The actual body of the function can be defined separately.</p>

              <p>A function declaration has the following parts</p>

              <code>return_type function_name( parameter list );</code>

              <p>For the above defined function max(), the function declaration is as follows</p>

              <code>int max(int num1, int num2);</code>

              <p>Parameter names are not important in function declaration only their type is required, so the following is also a valid declaration</p>

              <code>int max(int, int);</code>

              <p>Function declaration is required when you define a function in one source file and you call that function in another file. In such case, you should declare the function at the top of the file calling the function.</p>

              <h4>Calling a Function</h4>

              <p>While creating a C function, you give a definition of what the function has to do. To use a function, you will have to call that function to perform the defined task.</p>

              <p>When a program calls a function, the program control is transferred to the called function. A called function performs a defined task and when its return statement is executed or when its function-ending closing brace is reached, it returns the program control back to the main program.</p>

              <p>To call a function, you simply need to pass the required parameters along with the function name, and if the function returns a value, then you can store the returned value. For example: </p>

              <code>#include &#60stdio.h&#62
 
                /* function declaration */
                int max(int num1, int num2);
                 
                int main () {
                
                   /* local variable definition */
                   int a = 100;
                   int b = 200;
                   int ret;
                 
                   /* calling a function to get max value */
                   ret = max(a, b);
                 
                   printf( "Max value is : %d\n", ret );
                 
                   return 0;
                }
                 
                /* function returning the max between two numbers */
                int max(int num1, int num2) {
                
                   /* local variable declaration */
                   int result;
                 
                   if (num1 &#62 num2)
                      result = num1;
                   else
                      result = num2;
                 
                   return result; 
                }</code>

                <p>We have kept max() along with main() and compiled the source code. While running the final executable, it would produce the following result</p>

                <code>Max value is : 200</code>

                <h4>Function Arguments</h4>

                <p>If a function is to use arguments, it must declare variables that accept the values of the arguments. These variables are called the formal parameters of the function.</p>

                <p>Formal parameters behave like other local variables inside the function and are created upon entry into the function and destroyed upon exit.</p>

                <p>While calling a function, there are two ways in which arguments can be passed to a function</p>

                <h4>Call Type & Description</h4>

                <ul>
                  <li>Call by value: This method copies the actual value of an argument into the formal parameter of the function. In this case, changes made to the parameter inside the function have no effect on the argument.</li>

                  <li>Call by reference: This method copies the address of an argument into the formal parameter. Inside the function, the address is used to access the actual argument used in the call. This means that changes made to the parameter affect the argument.</li>

                </ul>

                <p>By default, C uses call by value to pass arguments. In general, it means the code within a function cannot alter the arguments used to call the function</p>
